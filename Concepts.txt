Routers in a DNN NoC are responsible for managing data traffic between PEs, using input/output buffers, switching fabric, and routing logic to efficiently forward data packets

router used to conenct PEs

Neurons in same PE means same router 

Network Dimension - The network dimension in a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture refers 
to the number of independent directions or axes along which routers and processing elements 
(PEs) are organized.

VC - A virtual channel is a logical pathway within a physical communication channel (or link) that allows multiple data flows to share the same physical link without interfering with each other
